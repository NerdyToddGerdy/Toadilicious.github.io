#Island Pillaging
##Brief description
My game is a land grabbing game with a pirate theme.  The objective is to grab islands before the other player does.  As the board starts to fill up you will be fighting the other player by attacking their spaces as well.  I based it off a game I used to play on my iPad called 'Strategery'. (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/strategery/id298908505?mt=8)
##technologies used
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
jQuery
Git

I attempted to use sweetalert2.js .

##installation instructions
There are currently none

##unsolved problems
-During the attacking Phase, if you press a space that only has one unit in it, the alert comes on and then you have to unclick the box still as opposed to the element to automatically going back to where it was.
-In the instruction pane, when adding units, the unit number does not count down.
-If you don't attack on your turn, you do not get a rebuild phase? needed to make sure that if you only have cells with 1 player, you can still win.


##expected updates
-Alert Box to become a Div
-I want to add the round # to the scoreboard area.
-I would like to adjust how it takes the health away from the player if the player loses the roll.
-I would like to add the dice to the board so I would know who won the roll.
-I want to add the ability to change the size of the map.  Adding more island would allow for a bigger challenge.
-changing the spaces from squares to hexagons, would give more options to attack from creating a bigger challenge.
-creating a computer player would also be fun.  Then it could become a one player game.
-Also making it possible to have more than 2 players could be pretty sweet.
